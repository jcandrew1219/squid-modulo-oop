## Description

This project was meant to help teach me objects along with jest and inquirer. I stated this project from scratch however I used many online sources as well as internal sources. This user runs node index.js in the terminal and enters the information the prompts ask for. Once the information is entered, the information is then used to produce a logo by means of objects circle, triangle and square.
